    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-regular-physical-activity"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-regular-physical-activity" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of regular physical activity?"></a>What are the benefits of regular physical activity?</h1><p>There are myriad benefits of regular physical activity, many of which are well known. Topping the list is improved cardiovascular health. Exercise strengthens the heart and blood vessels, reduces bad cholesterol, and lowers blood pressure. This in turn reduces the likelihood of heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>Physical activity also helps keep bones strong and muscles toned, reducing the risk of fractures and falls as we age. It also helps maintain a healthy weight, which is critical for preventing or managing conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.</p>
<p>Exercise has even been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels, improve sleep quality, and boost mood. All of these benefits together can add up to a longer, healthier life.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-regular-physical-activity-improve-your-overall-health"><a href="#How-does-regular-physical-activity-improve-your-overall-health" class="headerlink" title="How does regular physical activity improve your overall health?"></a>How does regular physical activity improve your overall health?</h1><p>Inactivity is one of the greatest threats to human health. Worldwide, less than half of all adults aged 18-64 years engage in the recommended level of physical activity for good health, and this drops to a fifth of adults aged over 65 years.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of evidence that regular physical activity (i.e. at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity) improves overall health. It can help prevent chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and cancer; improve mental wellbeing; and extend lifespan.</p>
<p>Regular physical activity has been found to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing obesity by up to 30%. Regular physical activity helps control weight because it burns calories, and it also makes people more likely to choose healthy foods and drinks. Overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk for many chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease by up to 50%. Physical activity can help keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check, which reduces the risk of heart disease. Regular physical activity can also improve your ‘cardiovascular fitness’ – how efficiently your heart and lungs work together when you are active. This is especially important as we get older and our ‘fitness’ declines naturally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 50%. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels, or when the body becomes resistant to insulin. Physical activity helps prevent type 2 diabetes by improving blood sugar control, increasing sensitivity to insulin and helping with weight loss. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a big difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing ovarian cancer by up to 25%. Ovarian cancer is an often fatal cancer that starts in cells in or on the ovary. Studies have shown that women who are physically active have a lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who are inactive. The most benefit seems to come from moderate-intensity activities such as brisk walking or cycling for 3 or more hours per week.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing breast cancer by up to 20%. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Studies have shown that physically active women have a lower risk of developing breast cancer than inactive women, although it is not clear exactly how much exercise is needed to achieve this benefit. Any amount of physical activity seems better than none at all!</p>

In children and adolescents, these benefits include improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, cognitive function and mental well-being. In adults, PA can improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, cognitive function, mental well-being, blood pressure control and risk for chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, PA is associated with increased lifespan.</p>
<p>The physical health benefits of PA are well-documented. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of studies involving 1.3 million participants showed that individuals who met recommended levels of PA had a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who did not meet the recommendations.1 In other words, engaging in regular PA can help you live longer!</p>
<p>There are also many mental health benefits associated with regular PA. These include improved mood, cognition and self-esteem, as well as reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.2 A Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials found that exercise is an effective treatment for depression in adults.3 Additionally, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that aerobic exercise was associated with reduced incidence of anxiety disorders in adults.4</p>
<p>So what is the take-home message? Engage in regular physical activity to improve your overall physical health and mental wellbeing!</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-important-to-be-physically-active-throughout-your-life"><a href="#Why-is-it-important-to-be-physically-active-throughout-your-life" class="headerlink" title="Why is it important to be physically active throughout your life?"></a>Why is it important to be physically active throughout your life?</h1><p>There is a lot of evidence that shows how important it is to be physically active throughout your life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Physical activity is important for everybody, regardless of age, sex, race, or physical ability.”[1]</p>
<p> Physical activity has been shown to have many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.[2] It can also help improve mental health,[3] bone health,[4] and weight control.[5]</p>
<p>Being physically active is especially important as we get older. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of falls and fractures,[6] improve cognitive function,[7] and increase lifespan.[8]</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get moving!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-tips-for-staying-physically-active"><a href="#What-are-some-tips-for-staying-physically-active" class="headerlink" title="What are some tips for staying physically active?"></a>What are some tips for staying physically active?</h1><p>There are many different ways to stay physically active, but one of the best tips is to find something you enjoy doing. That could be something as simple as taking a walk every day, going for a bike ride, or playing soccer with friends. If you don’t enjoy your chosen activity, it will be difficult to stick with it in the long run.</p>
<p>Another important tip is to start off slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your activity over time. This will help prevent injury and allow your body to get used to the new demands being placed on it. Finally, be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to stay hydrated.</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-beginners"><a href="#What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-beginners" class="headerlink" title="What is the best fitness gear for beginners?"></a>What is the best fitness gear for beginners?</h1><p>Anyone getting started in fitness is likely to have a lot of questions. What type of gear do you need? What should you wear? How can you make sure you’re getting the most out of your workouts?</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the best fitness gear for beginners:</p>
<p>#1 Resistance bands</p>
<p>Resistance bands are a great way to add resistance to your workouts, without having to invest in expensive equipment. They come in a variety of resistances, so you can find the perfect band for your needs. Plus, they’re lightweight and easy to pack up and take with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>#2 A good pair of sneakers</p>
<p>A good pair of sneakers is key for any workout. Make sure to choose sneakers that are designed for the type of exercise you’ll be doing. For example, if you’ll be running, choose sneakers that are made for running. If you’re going to be lifting weights, choose sneakers with good support and cushioning.</p>
<p>#3 A water bottle</p>
<p>Staying hydrated during your workouts is essential. Make sure to bring along a water bottle to keep yourself hydrated throughout your workout.</p>
<p>#4 A towel</p>
<p>A towel is another essential item for any workout. Towels can help keep you cool during hot workouts and can also help wipe away sweat.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-Crossfit"><a href="#What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-Crossfit" class="headerlink" title="What is the best fitness gear for Crossfit?"></a>What is the best fitness gear for Crossfit?</h1><p>There is no single answer to this question as the best gear for Crossfit depends on an individual’s needs and preferences. However, there are some pieces of equipment that are commonly used in Crossfit and that can be beneficial for athletes new to the sport.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to have when starting Crossfit is a good pair of sneakers. Crossfit workouts involve a variety of exercises, including running, jumping, and weightlifting, so it’s important to have sneakers that will provide adequate support and cushioning. Additionally, Crossfit workouts often involve band work and throwing weights, so it’s helpful to have a pair of shoes that won’t easily slip off.</p>
<p>Another essential piece of gear for Crossfit is a good quality weightlifting belt. A weightlifting belt helps protect the back by providing extra support during heavy lifting exercises. It’s also important to choose a belt that is the right size; if it’s too small, it will be uncomfortable to wear, but if it’s too large, it will not be effective in providing support.</p>
<p>Other pieces of equipment that can be helpful for Crossfit include resistance bands, jump ropes, and kettlebells. These items can all be used to add intensity and variability to workouts, which can help keep athletes challenged and motivated. Ultimately, the best fitness gear for Crossfit depends on the individual’s specific needs and preferences, so it’s important to experiment with different items until you find what works best for you.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-people-with-joint-pain"><a href="#What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-people-with-joint-pain" class="headerlink" title="What is the best fitness gear for people with joint pain?"></a>What is the best fitness gear for people with joint pain?</h1><p>If you have joint pain, finding the best fitness gear can be tricky. You need gear that is comfortable and will not aggravate your condition. Here are a few tips to help you choose the right fitness gear:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose comfortable clothes. Loose-fitting clothing is best, as it will not put pressure on your joints.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid shoes with high heels or narrow toes. Shoes with low heels and wide toes are best for people with joint pain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose equipment that is easy to use. If you have trouble using standard fitness equipment, choose equipment that is easier to use, such as an elliptical or recumbent bike.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try out different forms of exercise before settling on one. Some people find that exercises such as swimming or biking are less harsh on their joints than other exercises.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take care when choosing weightlifting equipment. Weightlifting can be tough on your joints, so make sure to use light weights and exercises that don’t require too much movement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t push yourself too hard. If you’re in pain, take a break and try again later. Pushing yourself too hard can actually aggravate your condition and make it worse.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-seniors"><a href="#What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-seniors" class="headerlink" title="What is the best fitness gear for seniors?"></a>What is the best fitness gear for seniors?</h1><p>As people age, they may find that their fitness levels decline. This can be due to a number of factors, including changes in hormone levels, a slowing metabolism and joint pain. However, it is not impossible for seniors to get into shape – in fact, there are many pieces of fitness gear that can help them do just that.</p>
<p>When choosing fitness gear for seniors, it is important to consider what activities the individual plans to do. For example, someone who wants to focus on cardio may need different equipment than someone who wants to focus on strength training. That said, here are some general tips for choosing the best fitness gear for seniors:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose equipment that is comfortable and easy to use. Seniors often have limited mobility and strength, so it is important to choose equipment that is easy to use and does not require a lot of strain or coordination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose equipment that is adjustable. Many seniors have different needs depending on the day – they may need more or less assistance one day compared to another. Equipment that is adjustable will allow them to customize their workout routine as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose equipment that is safe. Some fitness gear can be dangerous if not used properly – especially if seniors are working out alone. Make sure any equipment you choose is safe and easy to operate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over some general tips for choosing fitness gear for seniors, let’s take a look at some specific types of equipment:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Treadmills: Treadmills are a great choice for seniors who want to focus on cardio exercises. They are comfortable and easy to use, and most models are adjustable so that users can customize their workouts. Additionally, treadmills are relatively safe – as long as users stick to the speed limit set by the manufacturer!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ellipticals: Ellipticals provide a great cardio workout for seniors and are also very low impact. This makes them ideal for those with joint pain or other mobility issues. Ellipticals are also adjustable, so users can customize their workouts as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Weight benches: Weight benches are a great choice for seniors who want to focus on strength training. They are adjustable, so they can be used by individuals of any height or weight range, and they offer a wide variety of exercises that can target every muscle group. Additionally, weight benches are very safe – they come with built-in safety features that prevent users from overexerting themselves or getting injured while lifting weights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-women"><a href="#What-is-the-best-fitness-gear-for-women" class="headerlink" title="What is the best fitness gear for women?"></a>What is the best fitness gear for women?</h1><p>There is no shortage of fitness gear for women on the market these days. But with so many options to choose from, it can be hard to determine which pieces are the best for your individual fitness needs. If you’re looking for the best fitness gear for women, here are a few pieces that should be at the top of your list:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A good quality sports bra. A good sports bra is key when it comes to staying comfortable and supported during a workout. Make sure to choose one that fits well and offers plenty of support.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A pair of comfortable sneakers. It’s important to have a sturdy, comfortable pair of sneakers when you’re working out. Look for sneakers that are designed for the type of exercise you plan to do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A moisture-wicking tank top. During a workout, it’s important to stay cool and dry. Look for a tank top made from a moisture-wicking fabric to help keep you cool and comfortable during your workout.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A good quality yoga mat. Yoga is a great way to improve flexibility and strength, and a good quality yoga mat can make your practice more comfortable. Choose a mat that is made from a durable material and has plenty of cushioning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A set of weights or resistance bands. Strength training is an important part of any fitness routine, and using weights or resistance bands can help you achieve better results in less time. Choose a set that is appropriate for your skill level and goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
