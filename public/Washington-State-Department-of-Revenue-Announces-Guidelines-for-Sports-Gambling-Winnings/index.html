The announcement specifies that all such winnings are subject to state income tax, regardless of whether the winnings are paid out in cash or as a prize. In order to claim a gambling loss deduction on your state income tax return, you must maintain accurate records of your wagers and winnings.</p>
<p>The announcement also specifies that all betting must be conducted through licensed sportsbooks, and that any unlicensed activity is illegal in the state of Washington. This means that residents of Washington are not allowed to bet on sports with online offshore sportsbooks.</p>
<p>State income tax is currently assessed at a rate of 9.00%, and the Department of Revenue advises taxpayers to contact their local tax jurisdiction for more information on filing requirements and exemptions.</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Owing-Taxes-on-Your-March-Madness-Winnings"><a href="#Are-You-Owing-Taxes-on-Your-March-Madness-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Are You Owing Taxes on Your March Madness Winnings?"></a>Are You Owing Taxes on Your March Madness Winnings?</h1><p>The NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament is upon us and with it, the chance of winning big money. If you hit it big in the tournament this year, be sure to understand how your winnings will be taxed.</p>
<p>Most gambling activities are taxable in the United States. This includes winning money from a casino, lottery, or any other wager. However, there are some exceptions for gamblers who suffer losses.</p>
<p>Gambling income is reported on your federal tax return in one of two ways: as income or as a miscellaneous deduction. Income method is simpler because you report the full amount of your winnings as income and you can’t deduct any gambling losses. The miscellaneous deduction method is more complicated because you have to itemize your deductions on Schedule A and each deduction is subject to a 2% floor . This means that you can only deduct the amount of your losses that exceeds 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, if your AGI is $50,000, your deduction would be capped at $1,000 (i.e., $2,000 loss – $1,000 floor &#x3D; $1,000 deduction).</p>
<p>If you hit it big in the NCAA tournament this year and expect to owe taxes on your winnings, there are a few things you can do to minimize the tax bite. One option is to bunch your gambling wins and losses together so that you can offset them against each other. For example, if you have a total of $2,000 in gambling wins and losses for the year, you can net them against each other and report no taxable income from gambling. This won’t work if you have net gambling losses for multiple years because these losses can only be used to offset gambling income from the year they are claimed .</p>
<p>Another option is to establish a special-purpose entity (such as a limited liability company) specifically for holding your March Madness betting pool money . Income from the LLC will generally be taxed at the owner’s individual tax rate , rather than at the corporate tax rate. This could save you quite a bit of money come tax time. However , there are some drawbacks to using an LLC for this purpose so please contact an accountant or lawyer before setting one up .</p>
<h1 id="New-York-State-Announces-Tax-Regulations-for-Wagering-on-Sports"><a href="#New-York-State-Announces-Tax-Regulations-for-Wagering-on-Sports" class="headerlink" title="New York State Announces Tax Regulations for Wagering on Sports"></a>New York State Announces Tax Regulations for Wagering on Sports</h1><p>The New York State Gaming Commission has released a set of proposed regulations for sports betting. The regulations, 19 pages in total, were announced on Monday, October 15th and are open for public comment until November 5th.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations would allow wagering on professional and collegiate sporting events at licensed venues such as casinos and racetracks. In addition, online and mobile wagering would be allowed with the use of geolocation technology to verify that players are within the state borders.</p>
<p>Players would be able to wager on individual games or bets against the house. The regulations also set minimum and maximum betting limits, which will be determined by the Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>In order to place a wager, players must be at least 21 years of age and physically present in New York State. In addition, all bets must be placed through a licensed operator.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo praised the Commission’s work in developing these proposed regulations. “These proposed regulations continue New York’s leading role in creating a safe, fair, and responsible environment for sports betting,” Governor Cuomo said. “I encourage all New Yorkers to provide their feedback during the comment period so that we can create the best possible system for everyone.”</p>
<p>The proposed regulations come less than a month after the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited gambling on sporting events. The decision opened the door for states to legalize sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have moved forward with legislation to regulating sports betting. Delaware was the first state to offer full-scale sports gambling following the Supreme Court decision, while other states including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Michigan are in various stages of introducing legislation.</p>
<h1 id="California-Determines-How-to-Collect-Taxes-from-Illegal-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#California-Determines-How-to-Collect-Taxes-from-Illegal-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Determines How to Collect Taxes from Illegal Sports Gambling"></a>California Determines How to Collect Taxes from Illegal Sports Gambling</h1><p>The state of California has released draft regulations for how it will collect taxes from illegal sports gambling. The new regulations are part of the state’s efforts to legalize and regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>According to the new regulations, gambling operators will be required to pay a 15 percent tax on all gross gaming revenue. In addition, operators will be required to pay a 2.5 percent tax on bets placed by Californians.</p>
<p>The new regulations are designed to help the state coffers. In fiscal year 2018-2019, the state collected $29 million in taxes from legal sports betting. However, it is estimated that illegal sports gambling generated $1.5 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>California’s decision comes as several other states also move to legalize sports betting. New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting in 2018, and several others have followed suit.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting say that it will help combat illegal gambling and bring much-needed revenue to states. Critics argue that legalization will lead to more problem gambling and increase crime rates.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Releases-Guidance-on-the-Taxation-of-Sports-Gambling-Income"><a href="#Illinois-Releases-Guidance-on-the-Taxation-of-Sports-Gambling-Income" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Releases Guidance on the Taxation of Sports Gambling Income"></a>Illinois Releases Guidance on the Taxation of Sports Gambling Income</h1><p>On July 26, Illinois released guidance on the taxation of sports gambling income. The guidance provides that all income from sports gambling is subject to Illinois income tax, including winnings and losses.</p>
<p>Gambling income is generally included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, and most states follow the same principle. However, a few states exclude gambling income from gross income. For example, Nebraska excludes certain types of winnings from taxable income, and North Carolina excludes any net winnings from bingo, keno, and slot machines.</p>
<p>Under Illinois law, all gambling income is taxable, with a few exceptions. Gambling losses are not deductible for state income tax purposes. In addition, certain wagering activities are not considered to be gambling for state tax purposes. These include social games played for prizes with nominal value and fantasy sports contests in which the participants do not receive anything of value other than an opportunity to enter the contest and compete for prizes.</p>
<p>The guidance notes that taxpayers who have questions about how to report their sports gambling income should contact the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR). The IDOR has issued additional guidance on its website addressing specific issues related to the taxation of sports gambling income.</p>
