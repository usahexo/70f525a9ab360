        <h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-regular-physical-activity"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-regular-physical-activity" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of regular physical activity?"></a>What are the benefits of regular physical activity?</h1><p>There are myriad benefits of regular physical activity, many of which are well known. Topping the list is improved cardiovascular health. Exercise strengthens the heart and blood vessels, reduces bad cholesterol, and lowers blood pressure. This in turn reduces the likelihood of heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>Physical activity also helps keep bones strong and muscles toned, reducing the risk of fractures and falls as we age. It also helps maintain a healthy weight, which is critical for preventing or managing conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.</p>
<p>Exercise has even been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels, improve sleep quality, and boost mood. All of these benefits together can add up to a longer, healthier life.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-regular-physical-activity-improve-your-overall-health"><a href="#How-does-regular-physical-activity-improve-your-overall-health" class="headerlink" title="How does regular physical activity improve your overall health?"></a>How does regular physical activity improve your overall health?</h1><p>Inactivity is one of the greatest threats to human health. Worldwide, less than half of all adults aged 18-64 years engage in the recommended level of physical activity for good health, and this drops to a fifth of adults aged over 65 years.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of evidence that regular physical activity (i.e. at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity) improves overall health. It can help prevent chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and cancer; improve mental wellbeing; and extend lifespan.</p>
<p>Regular physical activity has been found to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing obesity by up to 30%. Regular physical activity helps control weight because it burns calories, and it also makes people more likely to choose healthy foods and drinks. Overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk for many chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease by up to 50%. Physical activity can help keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check, which reduces the risk of heart disease. Regular physical activity can also improve your ‘cardiovascular fitness’ – how efficiently your heart and lungs work together when you are active. This is especially important as we get older and our ‘fitness’ declines naturally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 50%. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to control blood sugar levels, or when the body becomes resistant to insulin. Physical activity helps prevent type 2 diabetes by improving blood sugar control, increasing sensitivity to insulin and helping with weight loss. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a big difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing ovarian cancer by up to 25%. Ovarian cancer is an often fatal cancer that starts in cells in or on the ovary. Studies have shown that women who are physically active have a lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who are inactive. The most benefit seems to come from moderate-intensity activities such as brisk walking or cycling for 3 or more hours per week.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce the likelihood of developing breast cancer by up to 20%. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Studies have shown that physically active women have a lower risk of developing breast cancer than inactive women, although it is not clear exactly how much exercise is needed to achieve this benefit. Any amount of physical activity seems better than none at all!</p>

In children and adolescents, these benefits include improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, cognitive function and mental well-being. In adults, PA can improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, cognitive function, mental well-being, blood pressure control and risk for chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, PA is associated with increased lifespan.</p>
<p>The physical health benefits of PA are well-documented. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of studies involving 1.3 million participants showed that individuals who met recommended levels of PA had a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who did not meet the recommendations.1 In other words, engaging in regular PA can help you live longer!</p>
<p>There are also many mental health benefits associated with regular PA. These include improved mood, cognition and self-esteem, as well as reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.2 A Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials found that exercise is an effective treatment for depression in adults.3 Additionally, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that aerobic exercise was associated with reduced incidence of anxiety disorders in adults.4</p>
<p>So what is the take-home message? Engage in regular physical activity to improve your overall physical health and mental wellbeing!</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-important-to-be-physically-active-throughout-your-life"><a href="#Why-is-it-important-to-be-physically-active-throughout-your-life" class="headerlink" title="Why is it important to be physically active throughout your life?"></a>Why is it important to be physically active throughout your life?</h1><p>There is a lot of evidence that shows how important it is to be physically active throughout your life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Physical activity is important for everybody, regardless of age, sex, race, or physical ability.”[1]</p>
<p> Physical activity has been shown to have many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.[2] It can also help improve mental health,[3] bone health,[4] and weight control.[5]</p>
<p>Being physically active is especially important as we get older. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of falls and fractures,[6] improve cognitive function,[7] and increase lifespan.[8]</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get moving!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-tips-for-staying-physically-active"><a href="#What-are-some-tips-for-staying-physically-active" class="headerlink" title="What are some tips for staying physically active?"></a>What are some tips for staying physically active?</h1><p>There are many different ways to stay physically active, but one of the best tips is to find something you enjoy doing. That could be something as simple as taking a walk every day, going for a bike ride, or playing soccer with friends. If you don’t enjoy your chosen activity, it will be difficult to stick with it in the long run.</p>
<p>Another important tip is to start off slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your activity over time. This will help prevent injury and allow your body to get used to the new demands being placed on it. Finally, be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to stay hydrated.</p>
