In less than 30 days, you can have your business up and running, and taking bets from customers.</p>
<p>To get started, you first need to decide what type of sports betting business you want to open. There are three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>brick-and-mortar store * online sportsbook * phone betting service</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has its own set of pros and cons, so make sure you choose the one that’s right for you.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on the type of business, the next step is to get a license. This process can vary from state to state, so make sure you contact your local gambling authority for more information. In most cases, you’ll need to provide some basic information about yourself and your business, as well as pay a license fee.</p>
<p>The final step is setting up your business. This will include setting up a website (if you’re going the online route), obtaining merchant services, and hiring staff. It’s also a good idea to find a reputable bookmaker to partner with – someone who can help promote your business and take bets from customers.</p>
<p>Starting a sports betting business can be a lot of work, but it can also be very rewarding. With a little planning and hard work, you can have your business up and running in no time.</p>
