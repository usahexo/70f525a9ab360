        <h1 id="Gambling-stocks-surge-as-investors-flock-to-high-yield-opportunities"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-surge-as-investors-flock-to-high-yield-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks surge as investors flock to high-yield opportunities"></a>Gambling stocks surge as investors flock to high-yield opportunities</h1><p>Following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, gambling stocks have been on the rise as investors seek high-yield opportunities.</p>
<p>The industry has seen steady growth in recent years, with revenues reaching almost $450 billion in 2016, up from $385 billion in 2012. This is due to a number of factors, including rising disposable incomes, the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing popularity of online gambling.</p>
<p>In fact, online gambling is now a $40 billion industry, and is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10% over the next five years. This is thanks to the growing trend of millennials gambling online, as well as the increasing acceptance of online gambling by regulators.</p>
<p>As a result, gambling stocks are becoming increasingly popular with investors, and are outperforming the broader market. The S&amp;P 500 Gambling Index has gained 36% since the start of 2017, compared to just 20% for the S&amp;P 500 overall.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this outperformance. Gambling stocks offer high yields relative to other sectors, with an average dividend yield of 3%. They are also highly levered to economic growth, as increases in disposable income lead to higher spending on gambling products. In addition, they are less sensitive to interest rate hikes than other sectors, as people will still gamble even if rates increase.</p>
<p>Finally, gambling stocks are relatively safe investments, due to their defensive characteristics and stable cash flows. This makes them attractive for investors seeking stability in their portfolios.</p>
<p>As a result, investors can expect continued outperformance from gambling stocks in the years ahead. The industry is booming due to rising disposable incomes and increasing acceptance by regulators, and this should lead to strong performance for gambling stocks in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Picking-the-right-gambling-stock-can-make-you-a-fortune"><a href="#Picking-the-right-gambling-stock-can-make-you-a-fortune" class="headerlink" title="Picking the right gambling stock can make you a fortune"></a>Picking the right gambling stock can make you a fortune</h1><p>When it comes to gambling stocks, there are a few things you need to look for before investing. You want to find a company with a strong history of profitability, good customer service, and a commitment to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>One company that meets all of these criteria is <company name>. They have been in business since 1978 and have a proven track record of profitability. In addition, they have an excellent customer service department, which is critical for any gambling company. They also have a commitment to responsible gambling, which means they are always looking out for their customers’ best interests.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a solid gambling stock, <company name> is the best option available.</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-looking-to-invest-Don’t-miss-out-on-these-gambling-stocks"><a href="#Are-you-looking-to-invest-Don’t-miss-out-on-these-gambling-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Are you looking to invest? Don’t miss out on these gambling stocks"></a>Are you looking to invest? Don’t miss out on these gambling stocks</h1><p>Gambling has exploded in popularity in the last decade. Whether it’s playing slots at a casino, betting on a horse race, or playing online poker, people are wagering more than ever before.</p>
<p>This explosive growth has not gone unnoticed by investors. A quick search of Yahoo Finance shows that there are currently several dozen gambling stocks listed on major exchanges. But with so many choices, which ones should you consider?</p>
<h1 id="The-big-boys"><a href="#The-big-boys" class="headerlink" title="The big boys"></a>The big boys</h1><p>The first group of stocks to consider are the industry giants. Companies like Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) are all well-positioned to take advantage of the growth in gambling. All three companies have built resorts in popular gambling destinations like Las Vegas and Macau, and they also have strong online presences.</p>
<p>These companies are all profitable and generate solid revenue growth. But they come with high price tags. LVS, WYNN, and MGM all trade for over 25 times earnings. While this may be justified if gambling continues to grow at its current rate, there is always the possibility that the industry will hit a plateau eventually.</p>
<h1 id="The-smaller-guys"><a href="#The-smaller-guys" class="headerlink" title="The smaller guys"></a>The smaller guys</h1><p>If you’re looking for a little more upside potential, you may want to consider some of the smaller gambling stocks. These companies are often younger and less established than the industry giants. But they also tend to be much cheaper, with valuations closer to 10 times earnings or less.</p>
<p>One example is Churchill Downs (NASDAQ:CHDN), the company behind the popular Kentucky Derby horse race. Churchill Downs isn’t just a gambling company - it also owns casinos, racetracks, and other gaming properties. But its core business is bettors placing bets on horses - an activity that shows no signs of slowing down. The stock trades for just 11 times earnings and pays a healthy dividend yield of 3%.</p>
<h1 id="Investors-bullish-on-gambling-stocks-for-2017"><a href="#Investors-bullish-on-gambling-stocks-for-2017" class="headerlink" title="Investors bullish on gambling stocks for 2017"></a>Investors bullish on gambling stocks for 2017</h1><p>The gambling industry had a strong year in 2016, with total revenue reaching $41.5 billion, up 3.5% from the previous year. This robust growth is expected to continue in 2017, as investors are bullish on gambling stocks.</p>
<p>One reason for the optimism is the legalization of gambling in new markets. In November 2016, Maine became the latest state to legalize casinos, joining six other states that have done so in recent years. Gambling is also expanding into new verticals, such as eSports, which generated $493 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>Another reason for the bullish sentiment is the improving economy. Consumer spending on gambling has historically tracked closely with overall consumer spending trends. As the economy continues to strengthen, we can expect gambling spending to increase as well.</p>
<p>Gambling companies are also benefiting from technological advancements. Online and mobile gambling has been growing rapidly, and this trend is expected to continue as more people shift to digital platforms. This provides opportunities for companies that can offer a high-quality user experience and innovative products.</p>
<p>All of these factors are contributing to the bullish sentiment on gambling stocks, and we can expect this sector to perform well in 2017.</p>
