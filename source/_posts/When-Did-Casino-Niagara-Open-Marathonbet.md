#  When Did Casino Niagara Open Marathonbet?

The casino industry can be traced back to the 1800s, when French aristocrats opened casinos in Monaco. The first casino in the United States was built in Nevada in 1905. But when did Casino Niagara open?

The first incarnation of Casino Niagara opened its doors to the public on October 14, 1996. It operated as a temporary facility while construction continued on the permanent facility, which finally opened on July 4, 1998. The opening of Casino Niagara helped to usher in a new era of tourism for the city of Niagara Falls.

Casino Niagara has undergone several expansions and renovations over the years. Most recently, it was expanded in 2016 as part of a larger project that included a new hotel and waterpark. Today, Casino Niagara is one of the largest casinos in Canada, with more than 2,000 slot machines and table games.
