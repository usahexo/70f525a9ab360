#  How to Turn $50 into $5,000 in Just 60 Days Playing Poker – Proven Strategy!

There is a lot of excitement in the air as the World Series of Poker (WSOP) nears. Millions of dollars will be won and lost during the 47 events scheduled from May 29 to July 17. One of the most popular events is the $10,000 no-limit Texas hold’em main event, which this year has a $10 million guarantee.

Many amateur poker players dream of hitting it big at the WSOP. But what if you don’t have the bankroll to compete in some of the bigger buy-in events? Don’t worry – you can still make a lot of money at the WSOP by playing smaller buy-in tournaments.

In this article, I am going to show you how to turn $50 into $5,000 in just 60 days playing poker. This strategy is based on a simple principle: play tight and aggressive preflop, then bet big when you have the goods on the flop.

I am not going to get into too much detail about how to play poker – there are plenty of other articles out there that can teach you that. Instead, I want to focus on how to use your hand strength and position to maximize your profits at the WSOP.

So let’s get started!

The first step is to choose your tournaments carefully. You should avoid big buy-in events with lots of entrants and instead focus on smaller buy-in tournaments with fewer players. This way, you will have a better chance of making it deep into the tournament and winning more money.

The next step is to play tight and aggressive preflop. In general, you want to fold most hands except for pocket pairs, Aces, Kings and Queens. When it comes time for you to act, you want to raise or reraise with these hands whenever possible. By playing tight preflop, you will minimize your chances of getting involved in unprofitable confrontations.

Now let’s say you are dealt pocket Kings preflop (or any other premium hand). What should you do? Well, if there are only a few players in the pot, then you should raise aggressively in order to build a big pot. However, if there are lots of players in the pot already or if there are lots of cards remaining in the deck that could help your opponents improve their hands (known as “wet boards”), then it might be wiser to just call or even fold your hand.

The final step is to bet big when you have a good hand on the flop. Once again, this depends on how many opponents are left in the hand and whether or not they can improve their hands by hitting future cards (known as “drawing hands”). If there are one or two opponents left in the hand and they cannot improve their hands very much, then it might be wise to bet all your chips (known as “going all-in”). However, if there are more than two opponents left or if there is a lot of potential for them improve their hands (e.g., there are lots of low cards still left in the deck), then it might be better just to check or call instead.

#  How to Make a Living from Poker – The Ultimate Guide 

Are you looking for ways to make a living from poker? If so, you’ve come to the right place! In this article, we will discuss everything you need to know in order to make a good living from poker.

First, let’s take a look at some of the basics of poker. Poker is a card game that involves betting and is generally played against other players. The aim of the game is to win as many chips as possible by making the best hand possible with the cards that you are dealt.

There are different variations of poker, but the most popular version is Texas Hold’em. In Texas Hold’em, each player is dealt two face-down cards (called hole cards), and five community cards are placed face-up on the table. The players then take turns betting on their hand, and the last player to bet or raise is required to show their cards first. The player with the best hand wins the pot.

If you want to make a living from poker, there are a few things you need to do: firstly, you need to learn how to play properly. There are many resources available online which can teach you how to play poker, such as YouTube videos and online tutorials. You also need to practice regularly; playing at home with friends or online is a good way to improve your skills.

Secondly, you need to build up a bankroll. A bankroll is simply the amount of money that you have set aside specifically for playing poker. It’s important that you don’t gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose – remember, this is a risky hobby! Start out by depositing $100-$200 into an online poker account and begin playing low stakes games. As your skills improve and your bankroll grows, you can gradually increase your stakes until you are playing for high profits.

Thirdly, it’s important to find a good poker Sharkscope graph tracking service). Sharkscope is an online website that tracks the performance of every player in every major online tournament. By studying this information, you can identify which players are profitable and which ones aren’t worth playing against. This knowledge will help you make more money at the table!

 Finally, don’t forget that bankroll management is key if you want to make a living from poker! Make sure that you always have enough money available in your account to cover potential losses – this will help prevent tilt (a state of mind where players start making bad decisions because they are angry or frustrated).

If you follow these tips, we guarantee that you will be able to make a good living from poker!
