#  Minimum Age to Enter Casino is 21 in Michigan

In Michigan, the minimum age to enter a casino is 21 years old. This is in accordance with the Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act, which was passed in 1996.

The act prohibits anyone under the age of 21 from entering a casino, whether they are a patron or employee. The only exception is if the person is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

Interestingly, the act does not prohibit minors from gambling in casinos. So, even though they are not allowed inside, they can still gamble from outside via electronic gaming devices.

There have been efforts in recent years to raise the minimum age to enter a casino to 23 years old. However, these efforts have so far been unsuccessful.

The legal age to gamble in Michigan is 18, but the MGCB notes that casino gaming is an adult activity and recommends that casino operators require patrons to be at least 21 years of age.
