#  Phoenix Suns Explode In Victory Over James Connection Casino Royale!

It was an amazing night at the Talking Stick Resort Arena as the Phoenix Suns came from behind to score a 103-94 victory over the James Connection Casino Royale.

Led by Devin Booker's 31 points, the Suns exploded in the fourth quarter, outscoring their opponents 35-16 en route to the victory. The win moves Phoenix to 5-5 on the season, keeping them in contention in a tough Western Conference.

"We just started knocking down shots and got some easy baskets," Booker said after the game. "Our defense was great throughout the game, and that's what led us to the win."

 Josh Jackson added 20 points and 11 rebounds for Phoenix, while TJ Warren chipped in with 19 points off the bench. They were helped by some poor shooting by Casino Royale, who only managed to shoot 39% from the field overall.

The Suns will now look to build on this momentum as they head into a difficult stretch of their schedule, playing Golden State, Houston, and Portland in their next three games.

PHOENIX, AZ - In a stunning upset, the Phoenix Suns managed to overcome a 20-point deficit in the fourth quarter and defeat the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers 124-119. The game was marred by a number of fights between players, none more surprising than the one involving James and Suns rookie Josh Jackson.

Jackson had been jawing at James all game, culminating in an incident with less than two minutes left in the game. With Cleveland up 118-114, Jackson stole the ball from James and went in for a dunk. James, clearly frustrated with Jackson's play, clotheslined him as he went up for the dunk. The two fought until they were separated by officials.

"It was just an intense game," said Suns center Alex Len. "Both teams were playing hard and it just boiled over."

Jackson downplayed the altercation after the game. "It was just basketball," he said. "I was playing hard and he took exception to it."

For his part, James would only say that he was "just trying to make a play." But many around the league saw it as a sign of frustration on James' part. He had been struggling all night, shooting only 7-of-22 from the field.

"LeBron's in uncharted territory right now," said one league source who asked not to be identified. "He's chasing Michael Jordan and he's starting to feel the pressure. Losing to Phoenix is not what he wanted on his resume."

The Cavaliers are now 5-4 since adding Isaiah Thomas to their lineup and trail Boston by 2 1/2 games for first place in the East.
