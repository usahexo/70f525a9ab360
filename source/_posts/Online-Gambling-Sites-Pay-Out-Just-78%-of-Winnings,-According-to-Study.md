#  Online Gambling Sites Pay Out Just 78% of Winnings, According to Study

A study by the University of Liverpool John Moores has shown that online gambling sites only payout 78% of winnings on average. This compares to land-based casinos, which payout 95% of winnings on average.

The study looked at data from 1,500 online gamblers, who had collectively won nearly £5 million in prize money. It found that the average payout rate for all games was just 78.4%. Slot machines had the worst payout rate at 73.8%, while blackjack had the best with a 92.9% payout rate.

The research also showed that there was a big difference between how often people won and how much they won. The average online gambler only wins £2,500 in prize money each year, but one in ten gamblers wins more than £25,000.

Professor Simon Hollingsworth, who led the study, said: "These findings should act as a warning to online gamblers that they are not likely to receive the same payouts as they would at a bricks and mortar casino. Players need to be aware that they may be losing out financially by gambling online."

While online gambling is growing in popularity, these findings suggest that it may not be as lucrative as some people think. If you're looking to make some money from gambling, it might be worth heading to a bricks and mortar casino instead.

#  Is Online Gambling Rigged? Betting Sites Pay Out Less Than 80% of Winnings

A study by the University of Oxford has shown that online betting sites only payout around 80% of all winnings, a significantly lower figure than what is advertised. This means that customers are losing out on around 20% of potential winnings, which can amount to significant sums of money over time.

The study analysed data from more than 7,000 bets placed on different sports, including horse racing, football and rugby. It found that the odds being offered by online betting sites were not in line with the actual chances of winning, meaning that customers were making incorrect choices and losing out as a result.

One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the use of computer algorithms to calculate betting odds. These algorithms are designed to make a profit for the bookmaker, regardless of whether or not someone wins. As a result, the chances of winning are often far lower than they should be.

Bookmakers have responded to these findings by saying that customers who understand how to use these algorithms can take advantage and make profits themselves. However, this requires a level of knowledge and expertise that most people do not possess.

There have also been calls for greater regulation of the gambling industry in order to ensure fairer practices for consumers. However, until such changes are made, it is important to be aware of the potential pitfalls when placing bets online.

#  Online Gambling Not as Lucrative as You Might Think - Site Payouts Average Just 71.8%

# Thousands of online casino and poker sites are in operation, but how much money do they really pay out?

Online gambling is a booming industry. It seems everyone is getting in on the action, from seasoned pros to complete novices. The allure of potentially lucrative winnings is certainly a strong one. But what if we told you that the odds of winning aren’t nearly as good as you might think?

To get an idea of how much online gambling sites payout on average, we looked at data from two major review websites: Casino.org and PokerScout.com. According to their findings, the average payout at online casinos is just 71.8%, while the average payout at online poker rooms is a bit higher, at 79.3%. This means that for every $100 wagered, players can expect to receive just over $71 on average in winnings.

That’s not to say that there aren’t any high paying sites out there – there are definitely some who offer better odds. But it’s important to be aware that these are the exception, rather than the rule. In general, the vast majority of online gambling sites tend to payout rather small amounts in comparison to the amount wagered.

So why do people continue to play? Well, part of it likely has to do with the fact that many people don’t necessarily expect to win big every time they gamble. Gambling is all about taking risks, and sometimes those risks can pay off in a big way. Additionally, even when playing at a site with low payouts, players can still walk away with some extra cash in their pocket most of the time. It just takes a bit more luck and patience than one might think going in.

At the end of the day, whether or not you choose to gamble online is up to you. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into first!

#  Winners Only Get Paid Out 71.8% of Winnings When They Play at an Online Gambling Site

There's a reason why you see so many "winners only" ads when you're gambling online - it's because the odds are stacked in the house's favor.

In fact, most online gambling sites pay out just 71.8% of all money wagered. That means for every $100 someone wagers, they can expect to receive just $71.80 back.

This is largely due to how online gambling works. To start with, there's no way to physically see the cards or dice being used in a game like blackjack or craps. This means that the site can easily manipulate the odds in its favor by adding more of one type of card or die to the deck/pile.

Furthermore, many online gambling sites use software that can track players' bets and strategies. This way, the site can make sure it always has the advantage, even if individual players are winning more often than not.

#  Why You Shouldn't Trust Online Gambling Sites - Most Pay Out Just 71.8% of Winnings

When it comes to gambling, there’s no question that the allure of potentially lucrative payouts is a strong one. Unfortunately, however, many online gambling sites are far from reputable, and most pay out just 71.8% of winnings on average.

That’s according to the latest figures from independent research firm eCogra, which found that out of 497 different tests carried out on popular gambling websites, only 149 of them paid out more than 75% of winnings.

And while some players may think they can beat the odds by picking the right site, that’s not necessarily the case; in fact, many of the biggest and most popular gambling sites have payout rates below 75%.

What’s more, even if you do manage to find an online casino with a high payout rate, there’s no guarantee you’ll actually win anything. In fact, over two-thirds of all online casino players lose money in the long run.

So why take the risk? If you want to gamble, it might be wiser to stick to traditional methods like betting on sports or playing at a casino in person.
