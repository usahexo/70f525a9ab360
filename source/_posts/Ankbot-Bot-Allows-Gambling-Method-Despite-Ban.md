The Ankbot bot is a new way to gamble that has been released in spite of the gambling ban in India. The Ankbot bot allows users to place bets on cricket matches and then receive the payout automatically.

#  Add a Gambling Function to Ankbot for Booty Bay

A gambling function will add a new level of excitement to Ankbot’s interactions in Booty Bay. This can be accomplished by adding a new button to the interface that opens a window for gambling. The window will contain a list of games, each with their own set of odds and prizes.

To start, we need to define some basic concepts. The first is the game instance. A game instance is simply a unique copy of a game with its own set of odds and prizes. Secondly, we need to define the interface for the gambling window. This window will have 3 components:

1) A list of games
2) Details for a selected game
3) Buttons to Start/End a Game



 
The list of games should be sorted by probability from highest to lowest. So, the game with the highest chance of winning will be at the top of the list. In addition, each game should be accompanied by its odds and prize amount. When clicking on a game in the list, details for that game will appear in the second component. This should include information like what type of bet it is (e.g., blackjack), how to play (e.g., rules for blackjack), and what the possible outcomes are. Finally, buttons to Start/End a Game will be placed in the bottom-right corner of the window.

Now that we understand the basics, let's implement it! We'll start by defining our GamblingWindow class:

class GamblingWindow(wx.Window): def __init__(self, parent, title): super(GamblingWindow, self).__init__(parent, title = title) self._gameList = [] self._selectedGame = None self._buttons = [] 

  In addition to inherited properties and methods from wx.Window , GamblingWindow has 3 private members: _gameList , _selectedGame , and _buttons . The first two are simply lists that hold all of the games and currently selected game, respectively. The final member is an array of buttons which will be used to control the gambling window. 

 Next up is our constructor which initializes these members: def __init__(self, parent, title): super(GamblingWindow, self).__init__(parent, title = title) self._gameList = [] self._selectedGame = None self._buttons = []

  Here we simply initialize our private members as empty lists and set _selectedGame to None since no game has been selected yet. 

 Now let's take care of creating our main window and adding our components: def __init__(self, parent, title): super(GamblingWindow, self).__init__(parent, title = title) # Create main window panel = wx . Panel ( self ) panel . SetSize ( 350 , 260 ) panel . Center () # Add components 

  We start by creating a Panel widget which will serve as our main window's root widget. We then set its size based on our desired dimensions and center it within the Window . Finally, we add our components: 

  # List of games lstGames = [ { "title" : "Blackjack" , "odds" : 95% , "prize" : 100 } ] for i in range ( 1 , 11 ): lstGames . append ({ "title" : "Spin %d" % i , "odds" : 50% + random . randint ( 1 , 49 ), "prize" : i * 10 }) lstGames . sort ( key = lambda x : x [ "odds" ]) self . _gameList = lstGames

  First we create an ListBox widget called lstGames which contains a list of games defined as follows:  The key attribute specifies what field or attribute these values should be sorted by when displayed in the ListBox ; in this case it's descending odds so that higher chance games are at the top. For brevity, we're only creating 11 games but you can easily extend this code to include more if desired. We also set up some basic event handlers so that users can select/deselect items in the ListBox and trigger events when particular items are clicked:  
def on_lstGames_itemActivated (self, obj): print ( 'Activated item {}' . format ( obj )) def on_lstGames_selectionChanged (self, lst): print ( 'Selection changed from {} to {}' . format ( lst [ 0 ], lst [ - 1 ])) selection_changed . connect ( self . on_lstGames_selectionChanged ) activate_item . connect ( self . on_lstGames_itemActivated )

  Next we add our GamblingWindow component itself: <
