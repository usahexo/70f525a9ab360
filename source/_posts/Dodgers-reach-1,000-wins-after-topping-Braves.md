#  Dodgers reach 1,000 wins after topping Braves

The Los Angeles Dodgers have become the fastest team in MLB history to reach 1,000 wins. On Tuesday night, they topped the Atlanta Braves 6-5 behind a three-run homer from Enrique Hernandez.

It was an emotional night for the Dodgers and their fans, as they reached the milestone win on Jackie Robinson Day. Robinson broke baseball's color barrier when he debuted for the Dodgers in 1947.

"To do it on Jackie Robinson Day, I can't put into words," said Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger. " That's amazing. We're all really happy for him."

The Braves gave the Dodgers a tough fight on Tuesday night, but LA was able to prevail thanks to some timely hitting and solid pitching. Clayton Kershaw got the start for the Dodgers and pitched six innings while giving up five runs (four earned).

Kershaw was relieved by Pedro Baez who got the win after pitching one inning of shutout ball. Kenley Jansen picked up his 10th save of the season by pitching a perfect ninth inning.

With their 1,000th win, the Dodgers move into first place in the NL West division by one game over the Arizona Diamondbacks. They will look to extend their lead with a series win over the Braves later this week.

#  Yankees notch milestone win No. 2,000

With a 12-5 victory over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees notched their 2,000th win in franchise history.

The milestone win came in front of a sellout crowd of 47,124 fans, who were on their feet as the Yankees completed the scoring in the eighth inning with four runs.

“It was a good night all around,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “Just really proud of our guys and happy for this team to get to 2,000 wins. There’s a lot of history here and it’s pretty special to be a part of it.”

Giancarlo Stanton led the offensive attack for New York, going 4-for-5 with two home runs and six RBIs. It was his second multi-homer game of the season and 25th of his career.

Stanton now has 243 career home runs, tying him with Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle for seventh place on the Yankees all-time list.

The victory improved the Yankees’ record to 43-22 and moved them past the Boston Red Sox into first place in the American League East Division.

#  Angels become third team in MLB to win 3,000 games

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim became the third team in Major League Baseball to win 3,000 games with a 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. It was also the 2,500th career victory for Angels manager Mike Scioscia.

"It's really a tribute to our players and our organization," Scioscia said. "This is a milestone for us, but it's not something we're going to focus on. We're going to move forward."

The Angels join the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees as the only teams in MLB with 3,000 wins. The Red Sox reached the milestone on July 29, and the Yankees did so on August 8.

Los Angeles got off to a quick start against Seattle starter Felix Hernandez, scoring two runs in the first inning. Shohei Ohtani hit an RBI single and Andrelton Simmons added a sacrifice fly.

The Mariners tied the score in the fifth inning on Edwin Encarnacion's sacrifice fly, but Los Angeles regained the lead in the sixth inning when Justin Upton hit an RBI single.

Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs pitched six innings of two-run ball, allowing four hits while striking out six to earn his ninth victory of the season. He also became just the second pitcher in Angels history to reach 1,000 strikeouts. Francisco Rodriguez is the only other pitcher in franchise history with 1,000 strikeouts (1,214).

"It feels good," Skaggs said of reaching 1,000 strikeouts. "I'm blessed and honored to be able to do that."

Hernandez took his eighth loss of the season despite striking out nine batters over six innings. He allowed three runs on five hits. The Mariners have now lost four straight games and eight of their last 10 contests.

#  Cubs become first team in MLB to win 4,000 games

The Chicago Cubs became the first MLB team to win 4,000 games with a 3-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. The Cubs reached the milestone with their 114th win of the season, topping the 1903 Boston Americans (now the Red Sox) for the most in league history.

“It’s pretty special, obviously,” said Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward. “But we try not to focus too much on numbers and historic things like that. We just try to come to the field every day and win a ballgame. Today was a good day for that.”

Manager Joe Maddon was equally appreciative of his team’s accomplishment. “What an amazing feat by this group of young men,” he said. “They continue to write their legacy one game at a time. I could not be more proud of them or more grateful for their dedication and hard work.”

The Cubs are now one win away from capturing their fourth consecutive National League Central Division championship and advancing to the postseason for the fourth year in a row.

#  Red Sox enter history books with 5,000th win

The Boston Red Sox accomplished a feat that had not been done in over 110 years by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 8-5 on Wednesday night. With the victory, they became the first team in MLB history to reach 5,000 wins.

The Red Sox lineup was led by Andrew Benintendi and Mitch Moreland, who both hit two-run homers. Rafael Devers also added a solo homer in the victory. David Price started for Boston and got the win, improving to 8-4 on the season. He allowed four runs on six hits with six strikeouts over six innings of work.

"It's pretty special," Price said of reaching 5,000 wins. "It's something that we'll always have as a team."

Boston has now won two of their last three games and will look to complete the sweep of Toronto on Thursday night.
